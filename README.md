# Time-Span
C++
Created a time calculator that could take 0,1,2, or 3 parameters and convert it into
the correct time, or calculate the two times. Used operator overloading in the case of 
inputs using the multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction symbols.
Doubles and integers could be used as input.
